rba - Reverse Bottle Adventure is a glitch used to abuse memory, it can be used to glitch medallions in your inventory and skip all dungeons. http://www.zeldaspeedruns.com/oot/ba/reverse-bottle-adventure
ww - Wrong Warp is a glitch used to teleport from one place to another and is also used to skip cutscenes at the end of dungeons. A good example is the deku WW to Ganon's castle as a kid to beat the game in under 25 minutes. http://www.zeldaspeedruns.com/oot/wrongwarp/wrong-warp
jp - Japanese text is faster therefore I can beat the game faster, it's the standard in competitive play.
